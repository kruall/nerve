# Observability — Langfuse

Nerve has an optional Langfuse integration for tracing the Claude agent loop
and Anthropic/Bedrock calls in the memU memory pipeline. When configured,
those SDK calls become spans in your Langfuse project, tagged with
`session_id`, `source` (`web` / `cron` / `telegram` / `hook`), `model`, and
`channel`. Codex app-server and OpenAI embedding calls remain visible in
Nerve's own structured logs and diagnostics, but are not currently exported as
Langfuse generation spans.

When the keys aren't set, the integration is a complete no-op — Nerve
runs identically with zero observability overhead.

## What gets captured

| Surface                       | Source                                               | Tags                                              |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Agent turns + tool calls      | `claude_agent_sdk` via LangSmith integration         | `source:*`, `model:*`, `channel:*` (when present) |
| memU Anthropic/Bedrock chat   | `anthropic` SDK via `AnthropicInstrumentor`          | `component:memu`, `purpose:summarize`             |

Trace-level attributes (`session_id`, `metadata.parent_session_id`,
`metadata.fork_from`) are propagated to every span emitted inside a turn
via OpenTelemetry Baggage.

## Setup

### 1. Get a Langfuse project

Two options:

- **Langfuse Cloud** — sign up at <https://cloud.langfuse.com> and create
  a project. Region picks: `https://cloud.langfuse.com` (EU, default),
  `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com` (US),
  `https://jp.cloud.langfuse.com` (JP).
- **Self-hosted** — follow the upstream deployment guide at
  <https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/deployment/docker-compose>, then
  point Nerve at the resulting host URL.

### 2. Get API keys

In the Langfuse UI: *Project Settings → API Keys → Create new API keys*.
Copy the public (`pk-lf-...`) and secret (`sk-lf-...`) keys.

### 3. Configure Nerve

Add to `config.local.yaml` (gitignored):

```yaml
langfuse:
  public_key: pk-lf-...
  secret_key: sk-lf-...
  host: https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

Restart Nerve. On startup you should see one of:

- `Langfuse: enabled (host=...)` — keys valid, tracing active.
- `Langfuse: disabled (no public_key/secret_key in config)` — keys absent.
- `Langfuse: auth_check failed against ...` — keys present but rejected.

Visit the diagnostics page (`/diagnostics`) to confirm the live status.

## Configuration reference

| Field             | Default                          | Notes                                                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `public_key`      | `""`                             | `pk-lf-...` — required to activate.                             |
| `secret_key`      | `""`                             | `sk-lf-...` — required to activate.                             |
| `host`            | `https://cloud.langfuse.com`     | Region endpoint or self-hosted URL.                             |
| `redact_patterns` | (built-in secret regexes)        | List of regexes — matched substrings are replaced with `[REDACTED]`. |

The default `redact_patterns` strip common secret formats: Anthropic API
keys, Langfuse keys, and bcrypt hashes. Add more for any project-specific
secret formats you don't want to leave the host.

## Privacy note

When enabled, **prompt content, tool inputs, and model outputs leave the
host** to whichever Langfuse instance you point at. The `host` field is
the boundary — make sure it points where you want the data to go. For
strict data residency, self-host Langfuse on infrastructure you control.

`redact_patterns` is a defensive layer — useful even with trusted
endpoints in case a secret leaks into a prompt accidentally.

## Disabling

Remove or empty the `public_key` / `secret_key` fields. No restart-time
flags, no feature gates — the lack of keys is the off switch.

## Cost cross-check

Langfuse computes its own cost based on token counts and a price model
maintained by Langfuse. Nerve's `db/usage.py` computes cost in-process
via a hardcoded `MODEL_PRICING` dict and the SDK's
`ResultMessage.total_cost_usd`. Expect minor mismatches between the two —
they're independent calculations. Treat Langfuse as a second source of
truth for catching local cost-tracking bugs.

### Prompt-cache pricing (usage rewriter)

The LangSmith `claude-agent-sdk` integration reports usage in
LangSmith's canonical format: `input_tokens` *includes* prompt-cache
reads and writes, with the breakdown only in `input_token_details`.
Langfuse's OTEL ingestion doesn't read that detail field, so without
correction it prices every cached token at the full uncached input rate
— a ~5-10x cost overcount on agent sessions, which are typically >95%
cache reads billed at 10% of the input price.

Nerve fixes this at export time: `init_langfuse` wraps the Langfuse
OTLP exporter with `nerve/observability/usage_rewrite.py`, which
rewrites each agent span's `gen_ai.usage.*` attributes from the
accurate `langsmith.metadata.usage_metadata` payload into the same
shape `opentelemetry-instrumentation-anthropic` emits (uncached input +
explicit cache-read / cache-creation counts). Langfuse then applies its
managed per-model cache prices.

The diagnostics status block reports this as `usage_rewriter: true`.
If it's `false` while `enabled` is `true`, the SDK layout probably
changed underneath the installer — agent costs in Langfuse will be
inflated until it's fixed. Known approximation: 1-hour cache writes are
priced at the 5-minute rate (Langfuse's OTEL mapping has no separate 1h
key).

## Troubleshooting

- **Spans aren't appearing.** Check `/api/observability/status` —
  if `auth_ok: false`, the keys are wrong. If `enabled: false` despite
  keys being set, look at startup logs for an `ImportError` on the
  `langfuse` package itself (run `uv pip install -e .` to refresh).
- **Spans are tagged but session_id is missing.** That can happen if the
  installed Langfuse SDK doesn't accept `session_id=` kwarg in
  `propagate_attributes`. Upgrade to a newer Langfuse Python SDK.
- **The host runs out of memory under heavy load.** The Langfuse SDK
  buffers spans and ships them async. If memory is tight you can drop
  the Anthropic instrumentation by editing `init_langfuse`, or deploy
  Langfuse self-hosted on a separate machine.
