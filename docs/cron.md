# Cron

## Overview

Nerve uses APScheduler for in-process async job scheduling. Jobs can run in isolated sessions (fresh each time) or persistent sessions (context preserved across runs) and deliver output to configured channels.

## Two-File Layout

Cron jobs live in two YAML files under `~/.nerve/cron/`:

| File | Purpose | Managed by |
|------|---------|------------|
| `system.yaml` | Built-in crons (core + productivity) | `nerve init` — safe to regenerate |
| `jobs.yaml` | Your custom crons | You — Nerve never touches this file |

Both files use the same format. On startup, CronService loads and merges both:
- If a job ID appears in both files, the **user version wins** (with a warning in the log).
- Old installs with everything in `jobs.yaml` still work — if `system.yaml` doesn't exist, all jobs load from `jobs.yaml`.

Running `nerve init` on an existing install regenerates `system.yaml` (e.g., to pick up updated prompts from a Nerve update) without touching `jobs.yaml`.

## Job Definition

```yaml
# ~/.nerve/cron/jobs.yaml (or system.yaml — same format)
jobs:
  - id: morning-briefing
    schedule: "30 11 * * *"        # 11:30 AM daily
    prompt: "Give me a morning briefing..."
    description: "Daily morning summary"
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6       # Optional model override
    target: telegram               # Delivery channel
    session_mode: isolated         # "isolated", "persistent", or "main"
    enabled: true

  - id: system-monitor
    schedule: "30m"                  # Every 30 minutes
    prompt: "Check system health and report changes since your last check."
    session_mode: persistent         # Keeps context across runs
    context_rotate_hours: 48         # Fresh context every 48h
    enabled: true

  - id: task-reminder
    schedule: "0 */2 * * *"        # Every 2 hours
    prompt: "Check for overdue tasks..."
    target: telegram
    enabled: true

  - id: repo-watch-nerve
    schedule: "1h"
    prompt_file: prompts/repo-watch.md   # Relative to this YAML's directory
    enabled: true

  - id: repo-watch-other
    schedule: "1h"
    prompt_file: prompts/repo-watch.md   # Same prompt, shared between jobs
    enabled: true
```

### Prompt Files

Instead of an inline `prompt`, a job can point at a file with `prompt_file`.
This keeps long prompts out of the YAML and lets multiple jobs share one
prompt definition.

- Relative paths resolve against the directory of the YAML file the job was
  loaded from (e.g. `prompts/repo-watch.md` next to `jobs.yaml` →
  `~/.nerve/cron/prompts/repo-watch.md`). Absolute paths and `~` work too.
- The file is read fresh on **every run** — edits take effect on the next
  trigger without a restart.
- If both `prompt` and `prompt_file` are set, the file wins; the inline
  prompt is used as a fallback when the file can't be read.
- A job must define at least one of `prompt` / `prompt_file`.

## Job Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique job identifier |
| `schedule` | string | yes | Crontab expression or interval (`2h`, `30m`) |
| `prompt` | string | yes* | Message sent to the agent |
| `prompt_file` | string | yes* | Path to a file containing the prompt (relative to the YAML's directory). Read fresh each run; shareable between jobs. *One of `prompt`/`prompt_file` is required |
| `description` | string | no | Human-readable description |
| `model` | string | no | Explicit model override. By default the selected backend resolves its own cron model (`agent.cron_model` for Claude, `codex.cron_model` or `codex.model` for Codex) |
| `cache_ttl` | string | no | Prompt-cache TTL override for this job's sessions: `5m`, `1h`, or `auto` (default: `agent.cache_ttl`). Sparse-schedule persistent jobs benefit from `1h` — see `nerve/agent/cache_policy.py` |
| `target` | string | no | Delivery channel (default: `telegram`) |
| `session_mode` | string | no | `isolated` (new session per run), `persistent` (reuse context), or `main` |
| `context_rotate_hours` | int | no | Hours before a persistent job rotates to a fresh chat (default: 24, 0 = never). The old chat is preserved |
| `context_rotate_at` | string | no | Time of day to rotate (e.g. `"04:00"`, in the configured timezone). Overrides the hours-based rotation |
| `reminder_mode` | bool | no | Persistent only: send short reminder instead of full prompt on subsequent runs (default: false) |
| `catchup` | bool | no | Fire once on startup if the job missed a run while the server was down (default: true) |
| `enabled` | bool | no | Whether the job is active (default: true) |
| `lock` | bool | no | Prevent concurrent runs of this job — the next fire waits for the previous one (default: false) |
| `run_if` | list | no | Run gates — preconditions that must all hold for the job to fire. See [Run Gates](#run-gates) |

## Run Gates

A **run gate** is a precondition evaluated right before a job fires. It answers
one question: *should this cron run right now?* Gates let a job stay idle until
there is actually something to do — no agent session is spawned (and nothing is
logged beyond a skip line) when a gate is unsatisfied.

Declare gates with the `run_if` key — a list of gate specs. **All gates must be
satisfied (logical AND)** for the job to run:

```yaml
jobs:
  - id: task-planner
    schedule: "0 */4 * * *"
    prompt: "Review open tasks and propose plans..."
    run_if:
      - type: tasks            # only when there's something to plan
        status: pending
```

When multiple gates are listed, the job runs only if every one passes:

```yaml
  - id: triage
    schedule: "30m"
    prompt: "Triage incoming work..."
    run_if:
      - type: tasks            # there is an open task AND
        status: pending
      - type: messages         # a source has unread mail
        sources: [gmail, github]
```

Gates are **fail-open**: if a gate errors while checking (e.g. a transient DB
issue), the run proceeds rather than being skipped — an occasional wasted run
beats a cron that silently never fires.

### Gate types

#### `tasks`

Satisfied when enough tasks match a status/tag filter. The canonical use is
"only run the planner when there is something to plan."

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `status` | string \| list \| `"all"` | omitted = any **open** (non-done) task | Status name(s) to count. A list counts across all of them; `"all"` counts every task regardless of status |
| `tag` | string | — | Optional tag filter |
| `min_count` | int | 1 | Minimum number of matching tasks required to run |

```yaml
run_if:
  - type: tasks
    status: [pending, in_progress]   # any of these statuses
    tag: backend                     # ...tagged "backend"
    min_count: 3                     # ...and at least 3 of them
```

#### `messages`

Satisfied when monitored sync sources have unread messages (compares each
source's max ingested rowid against the consumer cursor; never advances it).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sources` | list | — (required) | Source names to check (e.g. `gmail`, `github`) |
| `consumer` | string | `inbox` | Consumer cursor name used for the unread check |

```yaml
run_if:
  - type: messages
    sources: [gmail, github]
    consumer: inbox
```

> **Legacy shorthand.** The older `skip_when_idle: [<sources>]` /
> `idle_consumer: <name>` fields still work — they are translated into an
> equivalent `messages` gate at load time. Prefer `run_if` for new jobs.

### Adding a built-in gate type

Built-in gates live in `nerve/cron/gates.py`. To add one: subclass `CronGate`,
set its `type`, implement `is_satisfied`, `describe`, and `from_config`, then
register the class in `GATE_REGISTRY`. It becomes usable from `run_if`
immediately. This is the right path for gates that ship with Nerve.

### Custom gate plugins (drop-in)

To add your **own** gate without editing core source, drop a `.py` file into
the gate-plugins directory — `~/.nerve/cron/gates/` by default (overridable via
the `cron.gate_plugins_dir` config key). On daemon startup Nerve imports each
file and registers every `CronGate` subclass it defines with a non-empty
`type`. After that, `run_if` can reference your gate by `type` exactly like a
built-in. Because this never touches `nerve/cron/gates.py`, your custom gates
don't conflict when you pull Nerve upstream.

```python
# ~/.nerve/cron/gates/stale_tasks.py
from nerve.cron.gates import CronGate, GateContext


class StaleTasksGate(CronGate):
    type = "stale_tasks"

    def __init__(self, min_age_minutes: int = 30):
        self.min_age_minutes = min_age_minutes

    async def is_satisfied(self, ctx: GateContext) -> bool:
        # ctx exposes {job_id, db} — DB-only (see note below).
        ...

    def describe(self) -> str:
        return f"stale tasks older than {self.min_age_minutes}m"

    @classmethod
    def from_config(cls, spec: dict) -> "StaleTasksGate":
        return cls(min_age_minutes=int(spec.get("min_age_minutes", 30)))
```

```yaml
# ~/.nerve/cron/jobs.yaml — reference it like any built-in gate
run_if:
  - type: stale_tasks
    min_age_minutes: 60
```

A gate must implement the same three methods as a built-in (`is_satisfied`,
`describe`, `from_config`).

**Rules** (all fail-safe — a bad plugin never crashes the daemon):

- Files whose name starts with `_` (and `__pycache__`) are ignored.
- A plugin whose `type` collides with an already-registered gate is skipped
  with a warning: a **built-in always wins**, and among two plugins the **first
  loaded (filename-sorted) wins**.
- Any import error in a plugin file is logged (naming the file) and that file
  is skipped; the rest still load.
- **No hot-reload:** adding or changing a plugin requires a daemon restart —
  the same as every other piece of cron config.

> **Context is DB-only.** A gate receives `GateContext{job_id, db}`, which is
> enough for DB-driven conditions (task counts, source cursors, age filters). A
> gate that needs live runtime state — e.g. which sessions are currently
> running — is **not** supported by this loader; that would require widening
> the gate context, a separate change.

> **Trust note.** Files in the gate-plugins directory are imported (executed)
> at daemon startup. This is the same trust model as `config.yaml`, configured
> MCP servers, and cron prompt files — all user-controlled code/config the
> daemon already loads. Only place files you trust in this directory.

## Session Modes

### Isolated (default)

Each run creates a fresh session (`cron:{job_id}:{timestamp}`). The agent has no in-context memory of previous runs. This is best for self-contained jobs like daily briefings or cleanup tasks.

### Persistent

Jobs with `session_mode: persistent` maintain SDK conversation context across runs. Each job owns a **generation chat** — one session that is reused run after run until rotation:

- **First trigger**: Creates a fresh generation session (`cron:{job_id}:{timestamp}`) and runs the prompt.
- **Subsequent triggers**: Resumes the same SDK session and sends the prompt as a new message. The agent sees all prior runs of this generation in-context.
- **Context rotation**: Every `context_rotate_hours` (default: 24) — or daily at `context_rotate_at` — the current chat is **retired and a brand-new chat is started**. The old chat is preserved exactly as it was: it keeps its full message history, stays browsable (and resumable) in the UI like any other session, and ages out via the normal session archival policy. Retiring also indexes the old context into memU, cancels the old session's pending wakeups (so a retired thread can't resurrect itself alongside the new one), and retitles it with its end date (`Cron: {job_id} (until 2026-07-05)`).

> **Upgrade note.** Installs that predate generation chats used the stable id
> `cron:{job_id}`. That session is adopted as the current generation on the
> first run after upgrading — its SDK context carries over seamlessly — and
> moves to the generation scheme on its next rotation.

This is useful for jobs that benefit from accumulated context:
- Monitoring jobs that track changes over time
- Summary jobs that should remember what was already reported
- Multi-step workflows that build on previous results

Between runs, the SDK client subprocess is freed (no resource leak). On the next trigger, the SDK resumes the session from its stored state.

Rotation can also be forced from the Cron page ("Rotate") or via
`POST /api/cron/jobs/{job_id}/rotate` — same behavior: the current chat is
preserved and the next run starts in a fresh one.

#### Reminder Mode

Persistent jobs with `reminder_mode: true` avoid resending the full prompt on every trigger. Instead:

- **First run** (or after context rotation): The full prompt is sent, with a note explaining that subsequent runs will use a short reminder.
- **Subsequent runs**: A short message ("Scheduled run — continue with the same task as before.") is sent instead of the full prompt. The agent already has the original instructions in-context from the first run.

This significantly reduces token usage for frequently-triggered persistent jobs (e.g., every 15 minutes).

### Main

Jobs with `session_mode: main` run in the main user session instead of an isolated one.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# List available jobs (shows source and status)
nerve cron
#   [system] memory-maintenance: Daily memory cleanup (enabled)
#   [system] inbox-processor: Polls sources every 30 min (enabled)
#   [user  ] my-custom-monitor: Checks CI status (enabled)

# Run a specific job manually
nerve cron morning-briefing

# Check cron status
nerve doctor
#   [OK] System crons: ~/.nerve/cron/system.yaml (3/5 enabled)
#   [OK] User crons: ~/.nerve/cron/jobs.yaml (1 jobs)
```

## Built-in System Crons

These ship in `~/.nerve/cron/system.yaml` and are managed by `nerve init`. Running `nerve init` regenerates this file (e.g., to pick up updated prompts from a Nerve update) without touching your custom `jobs.yaml`.

| Job | Schedule | Session Mode | Description | Personal | Worker |
|-----|----------|-------------|-------------|:--------:|:------:|
| `memory-maintenance` | Daily 5 AM | isolated | Dedup, prune stale entries, improve memory wording. Runs silently. | ✅ always | ✅ always |
| `model-routing-auditor` | Daily 4:30 AM | isolated | On Terra/medium, reviews new interactive Codex sessions and updates versioned routing guidance only when evidence supports a reusable rule. Disabled unless selected. | optional | — |
| `inbox-processor` | Every 30 min | persistent (24h rotation, reminder mode) | Polls all sync sources (email, GitHub, Telegram). Triages, creates tasks, memorizes facts, sends notifications for urgent items. | ✅ default | — |
| `task-planner` | Every 4 hours | persistent (168h rotation) | Reviews open tasks, explores codebases, proposes implementation plans via plan-approve workflow. Gated on `tasks` (status `pending`) — stays idle when there's nothing to plan. | ✅ default | ✅ default |
| `skill-extractor` | Every 12 hours | persistent | Identifies repeated workflows from recent conversations, memory, and completed tasks. Proposes new skills via task+plan system. | ✅ optional | ✅ default |
| `skill-reviser` | Weekly (Sun 3 AM) | persistent | Reviews existing skills for accuracy (outdated paths, credentials), completeness (missing steps), and quality (trigger phrases, examples). Proposes revisions via task+plan. | ✅ optional | ✅ default |

**Mode defaults:**
- **Personal** — `memory-maintenance` (always on) + `inbox-processor` + `task-planner` enabled by default. `model-routing-auditor`, `skill-extractor`, and `skill-reviser` are presented as optional during `nerve init`; enable the auditor only with a Codex backend and configured tiers.
- **Worker** — `memory-maintenance` (always on) + `task-planner` + `skill-extractor` + `skill-reviser` enabled by default. `inbox-processor` is not included (workers don't have sync sources).

Both skill jobs use `source="skill-extractor"` or `source="skill-reviser"` on created tasks. When their plans are approved, the plan approval handler creates/updates the skill directly from the plan content (which is a full SKILL.md file) instead of spawning an implementation session.

## Persistent Timers

Cron schedules survive server restarts. On startup, the cron service queries `cron_logs` for each job's last successful run and uses that to restore correct timing.

### Interval alignment

For interval schedules (e.g. `4h`), the trigger is anchored to the last run time. If a job last ran 2.5 hours ago and the interval is 4 hours, the next fire is in 1.5 hours — not 4 hours from now.

### Startup catch-up

If a job should have fired while the server was down, it fires **once** on startup — regardless of how many runs were missed. This applies to both interval and crontab schedules.

- **First-ever run**: No catch-up (no history to compare against).
- **Multiple missed fires**: Coalesced into a single catch-up run.
- **Catch-up runs concurrently**: All overdue jobs fire in parallel, in the background (doesn't block startup).

### Opting out

Set `catchup: false` on jobs where a late run doesn't make sense:

```yaml
  - id: morning-briefing
    schedule: "0 12 * * *"
    catchup: false        # no point running a morning briefing at 3pm
```

Interval alignment still applies even with `catchup: false` — only the startup catch-up fire is skipped.

## Source Runners

In addition to YAML-defined cron jobs, the cron service auto-registers **source runners** from the `sync:` config. Each enabled source becomes an APScheduler job with ID `source:<name>` (e.g., `source:gmail`, `source:github`).

Source runners:
- Run on the schedule defined in their config (`sync.<source>.schedule`)
- Use `SourceRunner` to fetch → process → advance cursor
- Are logged in both `cron_logs` and `source_run_log` tables
- Appear in `list_jobs()` alongside regular cron jobs

See [sources.md](sources.md) for full documentation.

## Logging

Every cron and source run is logged in the `cron_logs` SQLite table:
- `job_id` — Which job ran (e.g., `morning-briefing` or `source:gmail`)
- `started_at` / `finished_at` — Timestamps
- `status` — `success` or `error`
- `output` — First 2000 chars of response / summary
- `error` — Error message if failed

Source runs also log to `source_run_log` with per-source diagnostics (records fetched/processed, errors).
