"""Propose a config change as a PR against the workspace repo.

This is how Nerve changes its own configuration when it can't (or shouldn't) edit
the live workspace directly — notably under lockdown, where runtime edits to
tracked config are blocked. Instead of touching the running workspace, it stages
the change in a throwaway git worktree off the branch sync pulls from, validates
it, pushes a branch, and opens a PR via ``gh`` for human review. Nothing in the
live working tree is modified (so it never conflicts with ff-only sync).

**What this is for.** A change that goes through here is reviewed, attributable
and recorded in the repository's history. It is not a barrier and cannot be one:
the agent has a shell, and a determined one can write the same files directly.
Lockdown and this tool exist so that the audit trail is honest, not so that the
alternative is impossible. That is also why a change with an executable effect is
*flagged* rather than refused — the goal is that the human approving the pull
request knows what they are approving.
