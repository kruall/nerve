"""Config-bundle validation for CI and ``nerve config validate``.

Validates the merged configuration the way :func:`nerve.config.load_config`
assembles it (workspace/config/settings.yaml + config.yaml + config.local.yaml),
but **leniently** with respect to secrets: ``${ENV_VAR}`` references that are
unset are treated as valid placeholders (they aren't present in CI) rather than
hard failures — unless ``strict_env`` is requested.

Structural problems are hard errors so a bad config PR fails CI before merge: an
unparseable or invalid cron file, a bad backend / codex config, a malformed cron
gate spec, a schedule the scheduler will not run as written
(:func:`_schedule_problem`), or a path setting written ``.`` — which aims nerve
at the daemon's working directory (:data:`_WORKING_DIR_PATH_KEYS`). Unknown /
misspelled top-level keys are warnings by default (a config carrying a key from
a newer nerve, or the shipped example, shouldn't fail CI) — pass ``strict_keys``
to promote them to errors.

**Validation never loads the bundle's own code.** Cron gate plugins are ordinary
``.py`` files that the daemon imports at startup; importing one to check it would
mean the bundle had already executed by the time we decided it was unfit — "an
invalid bundle is refused" is not a guarantee you can make about code you had to
run to judge. So validation does not load them at all, and it does not try to
divine what they declare either: a gate type it doesn't recognize is reported as
unverified, not accepted and not rejected. A plugin is code, and code is checked
by running it — that is the author's job, not the config validator's.

Built-in gate specs *are* built (``build_gate``), which runs nerve's own
``from_config`` with values from the bundle. That is what type-checking a gate
spec means; those three bodies parse their arguments and have no side effects.

    """Validate the config bundle rooted at ``config_dir``.

    ``workspace_override`` forces the workspace location (e.g. a checked-out
    config repo in CI: ``--workspace .``) instead of resolving it from
    config.yaml. ``strict_env`` promotes unset ``${ENV_VAR}`` references from
    info to errors. ``strict_keys`` promotes unknown/misspelled keys from
    warnings to errors (off by default so a config carrying a key from a newer
    nerve, or the shipped example, doesn't spuriously fail CI).

    ``portable_only`` drops the machine-local layers and judges the portable
    workspace config alone — the right question for a change headed to a shared
    repo, and the only way to get an answer that doesn't depend on the host
    running the check. It covers cron too: the loader's fallback to a legacy
    ``~/.nerve/cron`` is suppressed, so only the bundle's own cron files count.
    Pair it with ``workspace_override``: with no machine config left to read the
    workspace location from, it falls back to the default one.

    ``assume_locked`` judges the locked view whatever the bundle's own
    ``lockdown`` flag resolves to here. A fleet repo states the flag as
    ``${NERVE_LOCKDOWN:-false}`` so that one bundle can serve locked and unlocked
    boxes — which means CI, where the variable is unset, resolves it to false and
    validates the view *no locked box will ever run*. The lockdown checks then
    have nothing to fire on and the only machine that finds out is the locked one,
    at boot. This is how a config repo whose members include a locked instance
    checks the configuration that instance will actually load.

    """Why *job*'s ``prompt_file`` would not be readable when the job fires.

    ``resolve_prompt`` re-reads the file on **every run** — that is what makes a
    prompt editable without a restart — so a path that never resolves is not
    caught at load. The job loads, validates, schedules, and then fails only when
    it fires, which for a nightly job can be a day later.

    A missing file is fatal exactly when there is no inline ``prompt`` to fall
    back to. With one it degrades quietly to that instead, which is survivable
    but almost never what the author meant: a fallback is typically a short
    summary of a long prompt, so the job silently runs a lesser version of
    itself. That earns a warning, not an error.

    Three cases are deliberately not flagged:

    * a ``workflow`` job never calls ``resolve_prompt`` at all, so its prompt
      settings are inert;
    * a path still carrying a literal ``${VAR}`` is unset-by-definition here and
      gets the same leniency as every other unresolved reference in the bundle —
      the environment that runs the daemon is not the one validating it;
    * a path outside *root*, when a *root* is given. Under ``portable_only`` the
      question is whether the shared bundle is sound, and a bundle cannot be
      expected to carry a file the author deliberately kept on the machine. Same
      substitution ``_tracked_cron_only`` refuses one directory over: judging a
      config repo by what the reviewing filesystem happens to have. With no
      *root* the filesystem being validated is the one that will run the jobs,

    Two distinct mistakes, both silent without this check:

    * a 5-field crontab the scheduler rejects (``"99 * * * *"``) — the daemon
      does refuse to schedule that job, but only once the change has merged

      ``"@daily"``) — nothing complains about this one *ever*: it falls back
      to a fixed default and the job runs happily on a cadence nobody chose.

    Both are hard errors. Unlike an unknown config key, there is no

    read out of the scheduler code this validator is importing, so if nerve

# checkout. Everything above needs only the standard library plus PyYAML, so a
# bundle can be checked by cloning nerve and setting PYTHONPATH — no install, no
# dependency resolution of nerve's full runtime (boto3, telethon, ...). The
# generated CI workflow installs nerve and runs ``nerve config validate``; this
# path is for environments that cannot install it.
#
# Both are the same code, and they have to stay in step in both directions:
# identical output, and the same set of flags — a flag the CLI has and this parser
# doesn't is a documented invocation this path cannot run.
# tests/test_config_validate.py asserts both.
