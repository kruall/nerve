"""Agent engine — backend-agnostic agent orchestration.

Orchestrates per-session agent clients (Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI Codex
app-server — see :mod:`nerve.agent.backends`) and delegates all session
state to SessionManager. The engine consumes only normalized
:mod:`nerve.agent.backends.events`; every runtime-specific type stays
inside its backend module. Sessions are resumable across server restarts
via each backend's native resume mechanism, routed by the sticky
``sessions.backend`` column (docs/plans/codex-backend.md §3).

        Autonomous runtime turns (Claude CLI background-task
        continuations) are routed through the same pipeline as user
        turns: blocks broadcast live, assistant message persisted with a
        leading ``{"type": "auto"}`` marker, usage recorded, ``done``
        emitted.  Standalone task lifecycle events update the background-
        task chips without opening a turn.

        Never parks while no turn is open (only consumes what's already
        buffered via ``try_receive_idle_events``), so the pre-query call
        inside ``run()`` cannot hang on an idle runtime.  A buffered
        ``init`` system event means content IS coming — the drain opens
        the turn and waits up to ``first_content_timeout`` for the first
        content event.  If nothing arrives the empty turn is dropped and
        the watcher's next poll picks the content up instead.  Once
        content flows, the wait uses the same idle timeout as a normal
        run; on that timeout the partial turn is persisted and
        ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` propagates so the caller can apply
        hung-runtime treatment.

        Backends without an idle stream (codex) return ``None`` from the
        probe immediately — the drain is a no-op for them.

        Caller must hold the per-session run lock.  ``manage_framing``
        controls session-level run framing (mark_running/session_running/
        buffering): the idle watcher passes True; ``run()`` passes False
        because its own framing is already open.

        Returns the number of completed autonomous turns processed.
