# Connection pragmas applied on every ``connect()``. These mirror the tuning
# memU already uses for its own SQLite connections (see
# ``nerve/memory/memu_bridge.py``) — the primary operational DB is where the
# heaviest cron/CLI/backup contention happens, yet it was never tuned.
#
# Why each one matters:
#   journal_mode=WAL   — readers don't block the single writer. This setting is
#                        durable (persists in the DB file), but re-asserting it
#                        on every open is harmless and keeps intent explicit.
#   busy_timeout=10000 — milliseconds to wait+retry on a locked DB instead of
#                        failing instantly with "database is locked". The
#                        gateway, every CLI command (``nerve sync``/``doctor``/
#                        ``db prune``), and the scheduled backup are separate
#                        connections to one file; WAL allows a single writer,
#                        so the others must briefly queue rather than error.
#   synchronous=NORMAL — safe under WAL (no corruption risk; only the most
#                        recent transaction can be lost on an OS/power crash)
#                        and skips the fsync that FULL forces on *every* commit
#                        — the per-commit cost behind write-lock "wait hours".
#   foreign_keys=ON    — enforce FK constraints (per-connection; off by default).
#   temp_store=MEMORY  — keep temp tables/indices in RAM.
#   cache_size=-16000  — ~16 MB page cache (negative value = KiB).
#
# All but ``journal_mode`` are *per-connection* and must be re-applied on every
# open — which is exactly why this is centralized rather than set inline.
