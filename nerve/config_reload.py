"""Unified config hot-reload.

A single entry point that re-reads config from disk and reloads every subsystem
that supports it without a restart: the process config object (so lockdown and
settings changes engage), the long-lived services that captured that object at
start-up, cron jobs, cron sources, declarative execution kinds, MCP servers, and
skills. Best-effort per
subsystem — one failure is reported but does not abort the rest, because
refusing a valid cron edit over an unrelated typo in ``settings.yaml`` is the
worse outcome. Which subsystems fell over is reported, never inferred: see
:func:`reload_failures`.

Nothing reloads on its own. A reload happens when an operator asks for one
(``nerve reload`` / ``POST /api/config/reload``) or when a workspace sync merges a
change. Editing a config file on the box does not apply itself.

Restart-only (NOT reloaded here): the gateway socket (host/port/SSL), the
Telegram bot's token and allow-list, the MCP endpoint (including the
``auth.jwt_secret`` it checks ``/mcp/v1`` against, which the web gateway reads
per request), Langfuse, the memory bridges, the Codex thread-sync service
(``sync.codex.*`` — a different service from the cron sources under ``sync.*``,
and the one place those two names diverge), anything a service derived from
config at construction, and a background loop that was never started because its
feature was off. The hot-reload table in ``docs/config.md`` is the
operator-facing list of exactly what a reload covers; keep the two in step.

:func:`restart_required` diffs the old and new config over
:data:`_RESTART_ONLY_PATHS` and records what changed in the summary. Without it
the summary reports only what was applied, which a caller cannot distinguish from
"nothing needed applying". ``gateway.host``/``port`` are the case that matters:
they live in the tracked settings, so the change can arrive by workspace sync.

It reports; it does not gate. A setting whose only protection is a line in that
report is a setting the daemon is not applying — which is tolerable for a bound
socket and not for a policy that was tightened. Where the holder can resolve
config per read instead, that is the fix, and the path leaves this list: see
:func:`_repoint`.

    daemon: half the process runs on the new config and half on the old, with

    This list is deliberately short, and shrinking it is the better fix wherever
    it can be done: the agent backends used to need re-pointing and now resolve

    removed a second-level cache (``codex``) that re-pointing alone would have
    missed. Prefer that shape — one authority, resolved per read — over adding a

    Only objects whose config reads all happen per use are re-pointed. A value
    some other object *derived* at construction — a semaphore's size, a
    scheduler's timezone, a bot's cached allow-list, a bound socket — is not
    rebuilt and still needs a restart.
